## A beautiful quran app
Baraka is a free software made for reading or studying the quran. It allows you to stream recitations from more than 25 reciters and read among a hundred quran translations. Fast quran browser included.<br>
We are working on a digital and interactive Madani mus'haf, as well as multiple training modes or games.<br><br>
