## Important files
Two files are provided somewhere around here and these are essential for the app to work, even in Debug mode :
- glyphmap.db
- glyph_info.bks (this one can be generated using glyphmap.db using a method located in the MushafGlyphService)

## API structure
- mushaf
	+ fonts
		* QCF_BSML.TTF
		* QCF_P001.TTF
		* ...
		* QCF_P604.TTF
- reciters
	+ abbad
	+ alafasy
	+ ...
	+ info.json
- text
	+ am.sadiq
	+ ar.jalalayn
	+ ...
	+ sura_info.json
	
## Disclaimer
However you don't have any API access for the moment as it is stored in my hard drive in France.
So you practically cannot debug the app for the moment, unless you are brave enough to write an email at baraka.support@protonmail.com
Kind regards; may Allah enlight your day dear friend.
